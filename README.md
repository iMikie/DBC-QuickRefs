No one learns anything on the first try,  but what to keep close at hand?  
This is what I found I used all the time.  

Make your mods and pass it on to the next cohort.   
Good luck!

##Markdown
Some people never left the 80's.  For them the desktop publishing revolution never took place.  Pages, MS Word and PDF might as well not exist.  Instead, they have markdown.  Alas, you will have to learn it too. You write documents in plain text, putting in little secret codes.  Isn't that cute?  One advantage is that it can be stored with code as plain text.  You can even write it with a code editor if you can remember those secret codes.  That's where this cheatsheet comes in. 

###Normal text
For normal text, just type normal text, like this.

For a paragraph break, like the blank like above, hit return twice. 
Amazingly, hitting return once sometimes won't do anything (Depends on the version of the markdown). And hitting return more than twice doesn't register anymore.  In this case use `<br>`

`This line will break <br> in the middle` <br>
This line will break <br> in the middle

For **bold text** and *italic text*, simply type,  `**bold text** and *italic text*`

For ***bold and italic***, type `***bold and italic***`

For ~~strike through text~~ type `~~strink through text~~~`

For superscript,  x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 7, type ` x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 7`

###Lists

* Top level item     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   `* Top level item, start line with *`
  * Second level      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   `<tab> * Second level `
    * Third level   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   ` <tab><tab>  * Third level item <tab><tab>*`

You can also use '+' and '-' instead of '*'
