#Link_to


Unlike form_for and form_tags, link_to in Rails is not entirely worthless.  Here are the ones I think have some value.

###The simplest form
assuming your root route points to '/',
```html
<%= link_to "Home", root_path %>
# => <a href="/">Home</a>
```
By looking at rake/routes, you can find constants for the othe paths.  You'll probably have to magically know to add *_path*.

###Link-ing to a specific resource
This will create a link/route to the user record with id of 1.

```html
<%= link_to "Profile", @user %>
# => <a href="/users/1">Profile</a>
```
###Adding html classes and/or id to your link
Add id and class hashes after the path in the link_to method call. 
```html

<%= link_to "Section", root_path, :class => "my-class", :id => "my-id" %>
# => <a href="/" class="my-class" id="my-id">Section</a>
```
###Delete a record with link_to
Deleting a record requires a DELETE request.  Pass the *:method => :delete* hash as an option to the link_to helper.

```html
<%= link_to "Remove", @user, :method => :delete %>
# => <a rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/users/1">Remove</a>
```

###Require confirmation for deleting a record
Display a simple javascript alert box.

```html
<%= link_to "Remove", @user, :method => :delete, :data => {:confirm => "You Sure?"} %>
# => <a data-confirm="You Sure?" rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/users/1">Remove</a>
```

Of course non of this save you much from the regular HTML.  With the asset pipeline, addressing images can be a bit more tricky.  Here are a couple that provide a bit more value.

###Image Link
The link URI is probably relative to the assets or assets/images directory.

```html
<%= link_to image_tag('logo.png'), root_path, :alt => "MyLogo" %>
# => <a href="/"><img src="/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png" alt="MyLogo"></a>
Alt attributes are beneficial for SEO purposes and they also aid those visitors who use text readers or non graphical browsers.
```

###Link-ing to an image
You can use: image_path(*image_name*) to contain the image digest generated by the asset pipeline. 
```html
<%= link_to "Logo", image_path('logo.png') %>
# => <a href="/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png">Logo</a>
```

###Anchors with link_to
You might need to point to a specific section (anchor) in the page which you can identify by it's dom ID. So let's say on the target page we have a section that has the id="interesting-section". In order to point our link to that section, we'll need to add the anchor to the generated link.
````html
<%= link_to "Section", root_path(:anchor => "interesting-section") %>
# => <a href="/#interesting-section">Section</a>
```

Ajax links with link_to remote
I don't know how this works.  You can add the :remote => true option to the link to tell Rails that you want to handle the link via javascript. This option will automatically send an ajax request (handled via the jQuery UJS adapter).
```html
<%= link_to "Ajax", root_path, :remote => true %>
# => <a data-remote="true" href="/">Ajax</a>
```       
###Opening the link in a new tab or window
You can achieve this by using the target="_blank" html attribute which in Rails speak will look like this:
```html
<%= link_to "Google", "http://google.com", :target => "_blank" %>
# => <a target="_blank" href="http://google.com">Google</a>
```

###POST-ing using link_to
Sending a post request via a link is something that the html <a href> cannot do. You can only use it to make GET requests, not POST. That being said, Rails has some magic tricks for you.

By providing the :method => :post option, Rails will create a form and submit it via javascript. Note that you need the jquery-rails gem for this to work, if you don't have it, there won't be any magic happening and your links will default to a GET request.
```html
<%= link_to "Post", root_path, :method => :post %>
# => <a rel="nofollow" data-method="post" href="/">Post</a>

###Adding more params to the POST request
<%= link_to "Create User", users_path(:email => "jdoe@email.com", :password => "secret"), :method => :post %>
# => <a rel="nofollow" data-method="post" href="/users?email=jdoe%40email.com&amp;password=secret">Create User</a>
```
